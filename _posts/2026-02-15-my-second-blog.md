# Hello World!

This is my second blog for my Undergraduate individual project. 
In this post, I am summarizing the new concepts and steps, I learnt throught the class material posted for CST3990 by my professor
for weeks 1-4, and made a note of the important points to be addressed in my literature review report. 

Since my project is based on Software Development and not a research based project, I have understood that my literature review shall 
be based on the SDLC methodology of software development with minimal research regarding cloud kitchens.

My literature review report shall contain the following sections.
1. Scope of my project
2. Purpose of the project
3. Aim and objectives of the project
4. Performing research about online food business and critical review of cloud kitchens
5. Documenting the requirements of the project
6. Perform requirements analysis
7. Perform system analysis and design
8. Prepare a WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)
9. Preparing a Gantt Chart
10. Software Requirements
11. Hardware Requirements

This week, I would be conducting segment research on existing cloud kitchens, including a few visits to cloud kitchens in the UAE. 
My findings shall be documented in my literature review report.
